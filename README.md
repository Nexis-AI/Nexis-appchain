## Overview

AI services built on public blockchains struggle to prove work, manage stake, and coordinate rewards in a trust-minimized manner. Nexis Appchain addresses this by providing:

- A registry for agents, their metadata, service URIs, and delegated operators.
- Staking and slashing mechanics tied to task performance and verifier attestations.
- A task marketplace that escrows bonded capital while capturing inference proofs.
- Treasury-managed rewards, penalties, and insurance buffers.
- Subscriptions and rate-based streams so integrators can pay continuously for agent output.

The repository keeps parity with the Optimism monorepo while layering Nexis-specific contracts, configurations, and automation to deliver a Base-compatible L3 focused on AI coordination.

## Feature Highlights

- **Agent Registry:** Register agents, define metadata, advertise service endpoints, and delegate granular permissions for metadata updates, inference submissions, or fund withdrawals.
- **Multi-asset Staking:** Support ETH and ERC20 positions with configurable unbonding periods, early-exit penalties, and withdrawal queues. Stake can be locked against active tasks for accountability.
- **Task Marketplace:** Builders post paid work; agents bond stake to claim tasks, submit inference proofs, and receive payouts after verifier attestations or resolution of disputes.
- **Proof-of-Inference Pipeline:** Tasks emit commitments referencing input, output, model hashes, and external proof URIs. Verifiers with `VERIFIER_ROLE` attest on-chain to release payments or trigger slashes.
- **Treasury & Rewards Engine:** Slashes, penalties, and deposits are routed into treasury, insurance, and rewards pools. Governance-controlled withdraws and reward distributions keep incentives aligned.
- **Subscriptions & Streams:** Continuous payment rails for workloads that require recurring billing or per-second compensation, built to integrate with Base-native partners.
- **One-command Devnet:** `pnpm dev` brings up sequencer, batcher, proposer, challenger, verifier, and supporting services via Docker, auto-deploying Nexis contracts against a deterministic chain configuration.
- **Extensible Governance:** All contracts are upgradeable (UUPS) with role-based access patterns tailored for decentralized operations and future governance handoff.

## Architecture

### Rollup Layer

Nexis Appchain operates as an L3 rollup that settles to Base, inheriting Ethereum security via Optimism Bedrock. Chain parameters (block time, fault proofs, governance roles) are defined in `packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/AgentsL3.json` and consumed by the automated devnet and deployment scripts.

### Core Smart Contracts (`packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts`)

| Contract | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Agents.sol` | Registry for agents with staking balances, reputation dimensions, delegate permissions, and inference records. Integrates with treasury and task modules. |
| `Tasks.sol` | Bonded task marketplace enabling posting, claiming, submission, dispute, and resolution flows. Escrows rewards and stake with the treasury on completion or slashing. |
| `Treasury.sol` | Routes inflows between treasury, insurance, and rewards pools; handles slashes and penalties; pays rewards under governance control. |
| `Subscriptions.sol` | Recurring (epoch-based) and streaming (per-second) payment contracts that wire funds to agent owners while supporting ETH or ERC20 assets. |

### Operational Services

- **OP Stack Clients:** Directories prefixed `op-` (e.g., `op-node`, `op-batcher`, `op-proposer`) mirror Optimism's Go services tuned via Base-aligned defaults.
- **Devnet Orchestration:** `ops-bedrock/docker-compose.yml` plus `scripts/agents-devnet/up.sh` run a local rollup, funding test accounts and deploying contracts.
- **Bedrock Tooling:** `bedrock-devnet` Python utilities manage deterministic network snapshots for repeatable development and CI.
- **Indexing & Monitoring:** `indexer`, `op-heartbeat`, and `endpoint-monitor` provide observability for chain health, RPC availability, and latency.

### Developer Toolchain

- **Node & pnpm:** Monorepo management, TypeScript utilities, and orchestrated builds run through pnpm + Nx.
- **Go 1.21:** Core rollup clients and services are written in Go.
- **Foundry & Hardhat:** Contract tests cover both solidity unit tests (`forge test`) and integration checks against the live devnet (`hardhat test`).
- **Docker:** Required for local rollup orchestration.

## Network Configuration

Key parameters for the Nexis Base L3 devnet (see `deploy-config/AgentsL3.json`):

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| L2 Chain ID | `84532` |
| L2 Block Time | `2` seconds |
| Sequencer Drift | `600` seconds |
| Channel Timeout | `300` seconds |
| Finalization Period | `12` seconds |
| Governance Token | Symbol `NZT`, name `Nexis` |
| Fault Proofs | Enabled with max depth `73`, max clock `600` seconds |
| Devnet RPC | `http://127.0.0.1:9545` |
| Deployment Scripts | `pnpm --filter @eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock run deploy:agents --network agentsL3` |

When deploying to Base testnet or mainnet, adjust the configuration file and environment variables accordingly before running the deployment scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18 (monorepo enforces ≥ 16, recommended 18 LTS)
- pnpm ≥ 9 (`corepack enable`, then `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`)
- Go ≥ 1.21
- Python ≥ 3.10 (for `bedrock-devnet` tooling)
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose v2
- Foundry (`pnpm install:foundry`) and Hardhat (installed via pnpm) for Solidity workflows

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nexis-AI/nexis-appchain.git
cd nexis-appchain
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

`pnpm build` runs `nx` targets across the monorepo to compile Go binaries, TypeScript packages, and Solidity artifacts.

### Start the Local Devnet

```bash
pnpm dev &
sleep 20
```

The helper script performs the following:

1. Spins up the Bedrock stack (op-node, op-batcher, op-proposer, op-challenger, infra services) via Docker Compose.
2. Generates deterministic config and state snapshots into `.agents-devnet/`.
3. Deploys the Nexis contracts suite using the Base-aligned configuration.

Stop the stack with:

```bash
pnpm dev:down
rm -rf .agents-devnet  # optional cleanup
```

### Access the Devnet

- RPC: `http://127.0.0.1:9545`
- Default chain ID: `84532`
- Deployed contracts: artifacts stored at `packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/AgentsL3/`
- Hardhat network alias: `agentsL3`

### Run Tests

```bash
pnpm test                 # run nx test targets across packages
pnpm exec forge test      # run Foundry contract tests
./scripts/agents-devnet/hardhat-test.sh  # run Hardhat integration tests
```

Continuous integration can target `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and chain-specific smoke tests using the devnet scripts.

## Usage Guide

### Registering an Agent

1. Call `Agents.register(metadata, serviceURI)` from the desired owner account.
2. Optionally delegate permissions using `setDelegate(agentId, permission, delegateAddress)` for metadata edits, inference submissions, or withdrawals.
3. Update metadata or service endpoints at any time with `AgentMetadataUpdated` and `AgentServiceURIUpdated` emitting on-chain events.

### Staking & Withdrawals

- Use `stakeETH` or `stakeERC20(agentId, asset, amount)` to fund your agent.
- Set unbonding periods per asset with `setAssetConfigurations` (admin-controlled).
- Initiate withdrawals through `beginWithdrawal`, which queues a `PendingWithdrawal` released after the configured unbonding period.
- Cancel or execute withdrawals once they mature; early exits incur penalties routed to the treasury via `handleEarlyExitPenalty`.

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Create:** Builders post tasks from `Tasks.postTask`, specifying reward token, bond amount, metadata URI, optional input URI, and deadlines.
2. **Claim:** Agents lock stake using `Tasks.claimTask`. Locked stake is tracked in `Agents` to secure task delivery.
3. **Submit Work:** Use `Tasks.submitTask` with the inference commitment ID produced via `Agents.recordInference`.
4. **Attest or Dispute:** Verifiers with `VERIFIER_ROLE` confirm success (`Tasks.completeTask`) or flag disputes (`Tasks.disputeTask`).
5. **Resolve:** Authorized dispute managers slash stake or refund rewards through `Tasks.resolveTask`, which communicates with the treasury for payouts or penalties.

### Proof-of-Inference & Reputation

- `Agents.recordInference(agentId, inputHash, outputHash, modelHash, taskId, proofURI)` captures verifiable metadata.
- Verifiers register attestations with `Agents.attestInference`, unlocking rewards and reputation adjustments.
- Reputation weights by dimension (`reliability`, `accuracy`, `performance`, `trustworthiness`) are configurable to reflect desired incentive models.

### Treasury Operations

- Slashes and penalties call `Treasury.handleSlash` or `handleEarlyExitPenalty`, dividing inflows between treasury, insurance, and rewards pools according to `DistributionConfig`.
- Rewards teams distribute incentives with `distributeReward`. Funds can be paid directly to agents or delegated payout addresses.
- Governance can withdraw accumulated balances per pool using role-gated functions for treasury management.

### Subscriptions & Streaming Payments

- **Subscriptions:** `createSubscription` locks prefunded epochs and charges on a fixed cadence. `processSubscription` triggers payouts when epochs elapse.
- **Streams:** `createStream` starts a per-second payment window; agents call `withdrawFromStream` to collect accrued balances. Streams can be paused or cancelled with refunds governed by role permissions.
- Metadata URIs enable LangGraph or other orchestrators to fetch integration details tied to each subscription or stream.

### Events & Indexing

Key events are emitted across the modules (`AgentRegistered`, `StakeIncreased`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `VerifierAttested`, `RewardPaid`, `SubscriptionProcessed`, etc.). Use the provided `indexer` and `endpoint-monitor` services or integrate with your preferred ingestion stack to track lifecycle changes.

## Development Guide

- **Configuration:** Adjust rollup parameters and governance addresses in `packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/AgentsL3.json` before deploying.
- **Contract Deployment:** Update Hardhat network settings in `packages/contracts-bedrock/hardhat.config.ts` to target new environments, then run `pnpm --filter @eth-optimism/contracts-bedrock run deploy:agents --network <networkName>`.
- **Artifacts:** Deployment artifacts, ABIs, and addresses are written to `packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments/<Network>/`.
- **Go Services:** Build individual services with `go build ./op-node`, `go build ./op-proposer`, etc., or rely on `pnpm build` to run Nx orchestrated builds.
- **Make Targets:** `make <target>` wrappers are available for common flows (e.g., `make devnet-up`) if you prefer GNU Make.
- **Formatting & Linting:** Use `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:fix`, and Go's `gofmt` to keep changes consistent with repo standards.

## Troubleshooting

- **Devnet fails to start:** Ensure Docker resources are sufficient (≥ 8 GB RAM) and no prior containers are running on required ports. Run `pnpm dev:down` then retry.
- **Missing pnpm:** Enable corepack or install pnpm globally (`npm i -g pnpm`) before running repo scripts.
- **Foundry not available:** Execute `pnpm install:foundry` and re-source your shell (`source ~/.bashrc` or restart terminal).
- **Hardhat network mismatch:** Confirm `HARDHAT_NETWORK=agentsL3` or adjust RPC URLs in `packages/contracts-bedrock/hardhat.config.ts`.
- **Go build issues:** Install Go 1.21+, set `GO111MODULE=on`, and run `go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/ethereum-optimism` if fetching private modules.
