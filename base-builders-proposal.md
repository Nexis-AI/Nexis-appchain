# Base Builders Proposal — Nexis Agents Base L3

## Overview
- **Applicant:** Nexis Network
- **Project:** AI Agent Coordination Chain on Base (L3)
- **Goal:** Deliver a grant-ready, production-grade OP Stack L3 with agent staking, delegated permissions, proof-of-inference verification, and treasury-managed rewards.

## Problem Statement
Autonomous AI services lack an on-chain substrate that links verifiable inference proofs to staking incentives and recurring payments. Base developers need a turnkey rollup with these primitives baked in, along with LangGraph-friendly event streams and governance hooks.

## Proposed Solution
1. Ship an Agents registry with delegation, multi-dimensional reputation, and UUPS upgrades (`Agents.sol`).
2. Launch a task marketplace that escrows bonded stake, enforces proof-of-inference completion, and resolves disputes (`Tasks.sol`).
3. Operate a treasury that captures slashes/penalties and redistributes rewards via governance-controlled pools (`Treasury.sol`).
4. Provide recurring and streaming payments for agent services, compatible with Base-native integrations (`Subscriptions.sol`).
5. Package devnet automation (`pnpm dev`), deployment manifests, and LangGraph documentation for builders to reproduce.

## Milestones & Deliverables
1. **Deterministic Devnet:** Docker-compose spins a Base-aligned L3 and auto-deploys the agent stack (`ops-bedrock/docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/agents-devnet`).
2. **Agent Registry GA:** Registration, staking, delegation, and discovery functions with pause/upgrade paths and full Foundry coverage.
3. **Task Marketplace:** Bonded claiming, inference submission, verifier attestation hooks, dispute resolution, and treasury integration.
4. **Treasury & Rewards:** Early-exit penalties, slashing flows, governance-controlled pool withdrawals, and reward distribution events.
5. **Subscriptions & Streaming:** Recurring epoch charges and rate-based streams enabling Base’s commerce partners to integrate quickly.
6. **Documentation & Templates:** README lifecycle guides, LangGraph integration steps, RetroPGF and Base Builders submission templates.

## Budget & Timeline
- **Audit & Formal Verification:** $120k
- **Verifier / Oracle Incentives:** $60k
- **Ecosystem Grants & Integrations:** $70k
- **Maintenance & Ops (6 months):** $50k
- **Total Request:** $300k equivalent in USDC / OP / ETH
- **Timeline:** 12 weeks from grant approval to public devnet + testnet, 18 weeks to production mainnet with audits.

## Success Metrics
- Number of registered agents and bonded stake on Base L3 (`aggregatedStats`).
- Completed tasks with positive verifier attestations versus disputes.
- Treasury reward payouts to high-reputation agents.
- Adoption of subscriptions / streams by partner teams.
- LangGraph nodes replaying `InferenceRecorded` / `VerifierAttested` events for AI orchestration.

## Call to Action
Grant funding accelerates the AI Agent Chain for the Base ecosystem, enabling verifiable, incentivized AI workloads that align with Optimism’s impact=profit ethos. We are ready to collaborate on security reviews, governance onboarding, and partner integrations immediately upon approval.
